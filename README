this is a script to post things on gister for me from
the command line in an easy way.

Example:
cat dog | gister

this will attempt to create a gist that looks like this:
[prompt here]% cat dog
<contents of cat here>

There are a few things to configure.
First take a look at the .gister file. I suggest copying
it to home directory.

There are 3 configurable things here:
prompt. my preference given, don't have to use all keys,
but can't add new keys. if this is missing there will be
no prompt in the gist.
history_file. necessary for finding the command you've just
run. if this is missing, there will be no last command in
the gist.
private_github_url. if you plan on using the -p, --private
flags to point gister a private github deployment, set the
url here

otherwise all you need are two keyring values:
github token
pgithub token (if you use the private github deployment)
